# # Exercise 2.6 Add database to example backend. Submit docker-compose.yml

Cloned the following github repositories and used the answer from exercise 2.3.

Glory for the backend and frontend goes to Helsinki https://github.com/docker-hy

https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/

docker-compose up
```

# test

# Check with browser http://localhost:5000/
