### Remarks
Noticed later that I had very strainge chown-operation and this was causing bloated images also for the ready node images.
The steps with "chown -R app:dockerapp ..." caused the image size to grow 48MB per each. So by removing it and solving the COPY with chown was better.
So perhaps I could have done it also with the ready-images and reached the similar results.
